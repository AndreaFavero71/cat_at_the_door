## Short introduction:
This system is based on two devices: a **Stationary** unit and a **Portable** unit.
- The **Stationary device** is fixed inside your house, pointing ouside the door or area where your cats usually return.
- The **Portable device** is battery-powered and can be kept wherever you areâ€”working, relaxing, or just not near the door.<br>

Here's how it works:<br>
- The Stationary device includes a radar sensor that detects motion.<br>
- When motion is detected, it scans for **BLE tags** worn by your cat(s).<br>
- If a registered tag is found, the Portable device provides **visual** and **audible** notifications.

The devices communicate via **LoRa technology**, which ensures a strong and reliable connectionâ€”even across walls or floors.

## The devices:

The stationary device is wrapped with aluminium tape, on most of the faces, to prevent the radar from sensing inside the room.<br>

## The instruction manual:
A detailed 70-page instruction manual is available here: [How_to_make_CAT_AT_THE_DOOR.pdf](doc/How_to_make_CAT_AT_THE_DOOR.pdf) <br>
The manual is organized in several chapters, divided into 8 main sections:<br>
| #  | Section           | Description |
|----|-------------------|-------------|
| 1) | Introduction      | Project presentation |
| 2) | Supplies          | List of necessary parts |
| 3) | Make              | 3D prints, wiring, assembling, etc |
| 4) | Program           | Programming the boards |
| 5) | Tuning            | Adjusting the settings to your case |
| 6) | Troubleshooting   | An initial guide on what could go wrong, and how to move on |
| 7) | How to use it     | Explain how to use this system |
| 8) | Info              | Side information |

One of the chapters is the **To Do list** ðŸ˜Š
